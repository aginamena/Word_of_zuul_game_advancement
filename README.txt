World_of_zuul game is modeled on the original adventure game that was developed in the earyly 1970's by Will Crowther and expanded by Don Woods. The original game is also sometimes known as the Colossal Cave Adventure. This was a wonderfully imaginative and sophisticated game for its time, involding finding your way through a complex cave system, locating hiding treasures, using secret words and other mysteries all to an effect to score the maximum number of points. I implemented a beamer that can memorize the current room of the player and when fired, it transports you immediately back to the room it was charged in. And also, a transporter room that transports a player into a random room when he/she enters the transporter room
